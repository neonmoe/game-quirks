# Game Quirks
This is a small sentence generator that tries to formulate "game
ideas." It's mostly incoherent, but might sometimes cause a spark of
inspiration. Made for PROCJAM 2018.

## Running the generator
Just open [`public/index.html`](public/index.html) in your favorite browser. It should work
in any browser that supports JavaScript. Dropping the JavaScript
requirement is planned.

The other, easier way to use the generator is to use it on its itch.io
page, linked [here](https://nc.itch.io/game-quirks).

## License
The code is quite trivial, so there is probably little to no utility
in using any of it. That said, the contents of this repository are
distributed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
